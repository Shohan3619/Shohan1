		<h5> Al-Hamdulillah. Allah creates us as human. This is our best gift from our creator. Allah could make us other creation but Allah didn't. Our life is separated into two parts, one is Dunia and other is Akhirat. What we earn from Dunia that will we get in Akhirat. So, we have to work carefully. Dunia is not the place for getting reward. We have to continue our life as Allah says. Then we'll success in both lifes. ALWAYS BELIEVE IN ALLAH.</h5>
